# My Vault — Private Digital Library

A private, single-owner file vault for photos, screenshots, PDFs, documents and
videos. Upload from your phone or laptop, sign in on either, and see the same
library. React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind on the frontend; Supabase Auth,
Postgres and Storage on the backend. Built for libraries of thousands of files.

> **Upgrading from the first version?** Re-run `supabase/schema.sql` **before**
> deploying the new frontend. See [Upgrading an existing vault](#upgrading-an-existing-vault).

---

## 1. Architecture

```
Browser (React SPA)
 ├─ Supabase Auth (email + password, JWT in session)
 ├─ Postgres via PostgREST  ── public.files, public.profiles  (RLS: owner only)
 └─ Supabase Storage        ── private bucket "vault-files"  (policies: owner folder only)
```

There is no custom server. Every request carries the user's JWT, and Postgres
enforces access through RLS policies and storage policies keyed on `auth.uid()`.
The frontend holds only the public anon key. The service-role key is never used.

**Why Supabase (as you suggested):** it provides real password hashing and
sessions (GoTrue), Postgres with row-level security, and a private object store
with signed URLs, all in one project. The authorization model ("a row or object
belongs to `auth.uid()`") can be expressed directly as database policies, so a
bug in the UI can't leak another user's files.

### Data flow

| Action | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Upload | Client validates type/size → the object goes to `vault-files/<uid>/<folder>/<uuid>.<ext>`: files up to 6 MB as one XHR `POST /storage/v1/object/…` (real progress + cancel), larger files through Supabase's **resumable (TUS) endpoint** `/storage/v1/upload/resumable` in 6 MB chunks → a 480px WebP thumbnail is generated in the browser (images: canvas; PDFs: page 1 via pdf.js; videos: one frame via a `<video>` element) and uploaded to `<uid>/thumbs/<uuid>.webp` → a metadata row is inserted. If the insert fails, the uploaded objects are removed. |
| Browse | Paginated `select` (24/48/96 per page, infinite scroll), with filtering, sorting and search done **server-side**. One batch `createSignedUrls` call signs all thumbnails on the page (2h expiry). |
| Preview / download | A short-lived signed URL is created on demand (1h preview, 60s download). There are no public URLs. |
| Delete | Move to trash (`deleted_at`). Permanent delete removes the storage objects first, then the row. |
| Stats | One `vault_stats()` RPC aggregates counts and bytes. The client never downloads all rows. |

## 2. Database schema

`supabase/schema.sql` (idempotent, safe to re-run) creates:

**`public.files`**: `id uuid pk`, `user_id`, `original_name`, `display_name`,
`storage_path` (unique), `thumbnail_path`, `mime_type`, `extension`, `category`
(`image|screenshot|pdf|document|video|other`), `size_bytes`, `width`, `height`,
`page_count`, `duration_seconds`, `is_favorite`, `tags text[]`, `description`, `search_text`,
`created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_accessed_at`, `deleted_at`.

**`public.profiles`**: `full_name`, `avatar_path`, `preferences jsonb` (view, page size, theme — synced across devices), `storage_quota_bytes`.

**Indexes**: partial B-tree indexes per access pattern (active by date, by
category, favorites, recently opened, trash, size, name), a **trigram GIN index on
`search_text`** for fast substring search ("voic" matches "Invoice.pdf"), and a
GIN index on `tags`.

**Triggers**:
- `files_before_write` normalises names and tags, rebuilds `search_text`, and
  blocks changes to immutable columns (owner, path, size, type). It only allows
  moving files between Images and Screenshots.

**Constraints** `files_category_check` and `files_storage_path_format` are
dropped and re-created each time the file runs, so an upgrade picks up new
categories without touching existing rows.
- `files_enforce_quota` rejects inserts over the per-user quota.
- `handle_new_user` creates a profile for each new auth user.

## 3. Storage layout

```
vault-files/                (private bucket, 50 MB per-file limit by default)
  <user-id>/
    images/<uuid>.<ext>
    screenshots/<uuid>.<ext>
    pdfs/<uuid>.<ext>
    documents/<uuid>.<ext>
    videos/<uuid>.<ext>
    other/<uuid>.<ext>
    thumbs/<uuid>.webp
    avatar/<uuid>.webp
```

File names are UUIDs, so identical names never overwrite each other. The
original name is kept in the database.

## 4. Authentication flow

1. `/login`: `signInWithPassword`. Supabase hashes passwords with bcrypt, and
   nothing is stored in plain text.
2. "Keep me signed in" on: the session goes in `localStorage`. Off: it goes in
   `sessionStorage` and ends when the browser closes.
3. Every protected route is under `AppLayout`, which redirects to `/login` when
   there is no session and returns you to the original page after sign-in.
4. Forgot password: an email link goes to `/reset-password`. That page only sets a
   new password for a genuine recovery-link session. Signed-in users change their
   password in Settings, which re-verifies the current password first.
5. Settings also offers "sign out everywhere" (revokes all refresh tokens).

## 5. Security model (RLS)

| Resource | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `files` select/update/delete | `user_id = auth.uid()` |
| `files` insert | `user_id = auth.uid()`, and `storage_path` and `thumbnail_path` start with `auth.uid()/` |
| `profiles` | Read and update own row only. The only updatable columns are `full_name`, `avatar_path` (must be in own folder) and `preferences`. **Users can't raise their own quota.** |
| `storage.objects` | Bucket `vault-files` only. The first folder must equal `auth.uid()`. Uploads **and renames/overwrites** are only allowed into known subfolders. Executable extensions are blocked. Resumable (TUS) uploads go through the same policies. |
| `anon` role | No table or function access at all |
| `vault_stats()` | `security invoker`, runs under the caller's RLS |

The client never supplies the user ID used for authorization. It comes from the
verified JWT (`auth.uid()`).

Preview and download links are **signed URLs** (1 hour for previews and video
playback, 60 seconds for downloads, 2 hours for thumbnails). Storage only signs
a path when the caller's `select` policy allows it, so another account or an
anonymous visitor can't get a link to your files, even if they guess an
object path.

`npm run test:db` runs **68 security tests** against the real schema using PGlite
(Postgres compiled to WASM) with stand-ins for Supabase's `auth`/`storage`
schemas. The tests cover cross-user reads, writes, overwrites and deletes, path
spoofing, quota tampering, immutable columns, blocked file types, anonymous
access, the Videos category, and **upgrading a vault created with the first
schema** (`supabase/tests/fixtures/schema-v1.sql`) without losing rows or the
bucket size limit.

---

## 6. Supabase setup (about 10 minutes)

1. **Create a project** at <https://supabase.com/dashboard>. Choose a region near
   you and a strong database password.
2. **Run the schema**: open *SQL Editor → New query*, paste all of
   `supabase/schema.sql`, and click **Run**. This creates the tables, indexes,
   policies, triggers and the private `vault-files` bucket.
3. **Lock down sign-ups** (this is a personal vault): go to *Authentication →
   Sign In / Providers*, keep **Email** enabled, and turn **off** "Allow new users
   to sign up". The app has no sign-up screen, but while that switch is on,
   anyone holding the public anon key could create an account through the API.
   RLS would still keep them out of your files, but they could use your storage.
   To give a second person their own separate vault later, add them under
   *Authentication → Users*. Every account only ever sees its own files.
4. **Create your account**: go to *Authentication → Users → Add user → Create new
   user*, enter your email and a strong password, and tick **Auto Confirm User**.
5. **URL configuration** (*Authentication → URL Configuration*):
   - Site URL: your production URL (or `http://localhost:5173` while developing)
   - Redirect URLs: add `http://localhost:5173/**` and `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/**`
     (needed for password-reset links)
6. **Get your keys**: go to *Project Settings → API* and copy the **Project URL**
   and the **anon / publishable** key. **Never copy the `service_role` / secret
   key into this app.**
7. **Storage quota**: the default per-user quota is 1 GB (the Free plan total). On
   a paid plan, raise it:
   ```sql
   update public.profiles set storage_quota_bytes = 100::bigint * 1024 * 1024 * 1024; -- 100 GB
   ```
8. **Per-file size limit (important for videos)**: the bucket allows 50 MB,
   the Free-plan maximum. That's about 30 seconds of 4K or 1–2 minutes of 1080p
   phone video. To store longer videos, upgrade to a paid plan, then:
   1. raise the global limit (*Project Settings → Storage → Upload file size
      limit*, up to 500 GB on Pro),
   2. raise the bucket's limit (*Storage → vault-files → Edit bucket → Restrict
      file upload size*), or run
      `update storage.buckets set file_size_limit = 5368709120 where id = 'vault-files';` (5 GB),
   3. set `VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` to the same value (e.g. `5120`) and redeploy the
      frontend,
   4. raise your storage quota (step 7) so it has room.

   Re-running `schema.sql` keeps a limit you raised.
   Files over 6 MB always use resumable uploads, which need no extra setup.
9. Recommended hardening: set a minimum password length of at least 12
   (*Authentication → Policies*), and enable leaked-password protection
   (Pro plan).

## Upgrading an existing vault

Schema changes aren't applied automatically. For a vault created with an
earlier version of this project (before Videos):

1. **Back up first** (optional but recommended): *Database → Backups* on paid
   plans, or export `public.files` from the Table Editor.
2. Open *SQL Editor → New query*, paste all of the current
   `supabase/schema.sql`, and click **Run**. It is idempotent and only adds
   things:
   - adds the nullable `files.duration_seconds` column,
   - re-creates `files_category_check` and `files_storage_path_format` to allow
     `video` / `videos/`,
   - replaces `vault_stats()` (adds `videos`),
   - replaces the storage insert/update policies (allow `videos/`; renames can
     no longer produce a blocked extension or unknown folder),
   - keeps the bucket private **without** resetting a size limit you raised.
   Existing rows, objects, profiles and quotas are untouched.
3. Deploy the new frontend **after** step 2. The new build reads
   `duration_seconds`, so running it against the old schema fails to list
   files.
4. Videos uploaded before the upgrade are stored under **Other**. They stay
   there, because an object's category and path are immutable. To move one,
   download it, delete it, and upload it again.

`npm run test:db` checks this exact upgrade against a snapshot of the original
schema.

## 7. Local development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # then fill in VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:5173
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript
npm run build       # typecheck + production build into dist/
npm run preview     # serve the production build locally
npm run test:db     # database / RLS security tests (no Supabase needed)
```

## 8. Deploying the frontend

The app is a static SPA, so any static host works. Set the two `VITE_` variables
in the host's environment settings. Never commit `.env.local`.

**Vercel (recommended):** import the repo, keep the Vite preset (build `npm run
build`, output `dist`), add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and
optionally `VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB`, then deploy. `vercel.json` provides SPA
rewrites and security headers (CSP, frame denial, nosniff).

**Netlify:** push the project files themselves to the repo (`package.json` must
be in the repository root, not inside a `.zip` or a subfolder), then import the
repo. `netlify.toml` sets the build command (`npm run build`), the publish
directory (`dist`) and Node 22. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
and optionally `VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` under *Site configuration → Environment
variables*, then trigger a new deploy. `public/_redirects` and `public/_headers`
provide SPA routing and the security headers.

After deploying, add the production URL to Supabase **Site URL** and **Redirect
URLs** (step 5).

The Content-Security-Policy allows `https://*.supabase.co`. If you use a Supabase
custom domain, add it to `connect-src`, `img-src` and `media-src` in
`vercel.json` / `public/_headers`.

```
supabase/
  schema.sql              all tables, indexes, triggers, RLS and storage policies (also the upgrade script)
  tests/rls.test.mjs      security + upgrade tests (npm run test:db)
  tests/fixtures/         schema-v1.sql: the original schema, used by the upgrade test

  context/                Auth, Upload queue, File actions
  hooks/                  useFiles (infinite query), useFileFilters (URL state), useProfile
  services/               files, upload, profile (all Supabase calls)
  lib/                    supabase client, categories registry, views, pdf, thumbnails,
                          preview rules, errors, query cache
  types/, utils/
```

**Adding a file category:** add it to `src/lib/categories.ts` (including
`CATEGORY_STAT_KEY`), extend `files_category_check`,
`files_storage_path_format`, the two storage folder lists and `vault_stats()`
in `schema.sql`, add the count to `VaultStats` in `src/types`, and add a view in
`src/lib/views.ts`. Then add tests to `rls.test.mjs`.

## 10. Performance notes

- Nothing loads "all files". Lists are paged (24/48/96) with infinite scroll and
  a "Load more" fallback. Counts come from `vault_stats()`.
- Galleries show 480px WebP thumbnails, lazy-loaded, never the originals. Off-
  screen cards skip layout via `content-visibility`.
- Search, filters and sorting run in Postgres using the indexes above.
  Previous results stay visible while a new query loads.
- pdf.js, mammoth (DOCX) and the ZIP library load only when first needed.
- Uploads run three at a time in the background, and the UI stays usable.
  Closing the tab mid-upload triggers a browser warning. Progress re-renders
  only when a percentage changes.
- Videos are **never read into memory**. The thumbnail comes from one frame
  decoded by a `<video>` element through a `blob:` URL, with a 12 s timeout.
  Resumable uploads send 6 MB slices. Images over 60 MB and PDFs over 80 MB
  skip thumbnail generation.

### Uploading from phones and laptops

Browsers can't scan or sync a device's folders on their own. You always choose
files yourself:

- **Choose files** opens the OS picker. On iPhone that means Photo Library,
  Take Photo or Video, or Choose File (Files / iCloud Drive). On Android it's
  the system file picker (Photos, Files, Drive).
- **Photos & videos** opens the photo/video gallery directly on most phones.
- **Drag & drop** works anywhere in the app on desktop.
- **Choose folder** appears only on desktop browsers that support folder
  selection (`webkitdirectory`). It uploads every file in the chosen folder and
  skips hidden files, `Thumbs.db` and `desktop.ini`. Everywhere else, use
  multi-select instead.

Uploads never sync automatically. New photos on your phone appear in the vault
only after you upload them.

### Large uploads (resumable)

Files over 6 MB use Supabase Storage's TUS resumable endpoint
(`<VITE_SUPABASE_URL>/storage/v1/upload/resumable`). No dashboard setup is
needed, and the same RLS policies apply.
- Dropped connections retry automatically: 0, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 seconds.
- If it still fails, **Resume** in the upload panel continues from the last
  confirmed 6 MB chunk.
- If the tab was closed, select the **same file** again within about 23 hours
  and the upload continues where it stopped. Supabase discards unfinished
  uploads after 24 hours.
- A fresh access token is attached to every chunk, so uploads longer than the
  1-hour JWT lifetime still work.
- **Cancel** discards the partial upload on the server.
- The per-file limit is still the bucket's size limit (setup step 8).

## 11. Review results and known limitations

Verified: TypeScript strict build passes, the production build passes, and
68/68 database security tests pass. The first release was also exercised in a
browser against a mock API (login, dashboard, galleries, lightbox, PDF viewer,
search, list view, trash with undo, bulk selection, delete confirmation,
upload pipeline, settings, dark mode, mobile drawer, and the production CSP with
the PDF worker and lazy chunks). The Videos category, resumable uploads,
video thumbnails/player and the upload picker changes have been checked by
typecheck, build and the database tests only.

**Neither release has been run against a live Supabase project or on real
phones yet.** After setup, do one end-to-end check: from a phone, upload a
photo, a PDF, a DOCX/TXT and an MP4/MOV (one larger than 6 MB). Then sign in on
a laptop and confirm each one is in the right category and previews or
downloads.

Limitations to be aware of:
- **Not end-to-end encrypted.** Files are private to your account and encrypted
  at rest by Supabase, but anyone with admin access to the Supabase project can
  read them.
- **Previews:** HEIC displays only in Safari (other browsers show an icon plus
  download). DOCX previews are a simplified rendering. DOC, RTF, ODT and
  spreadsheets have no in-browser preview; the app says so and offers
  Download / Open instead.
- **Video playback depends on the browser's codecs.** MP4/M4V (H.264) plays
  everywhere. MOV plays in Safari, and in Chrome/Edge/Firefox when it is H.264.
  iPhone HEVC (H.265) videos may not play outside Safari or on older Windows.
  In those cases the player says so and offers **Download**. AVI, WMV, FLV,
  MPEG, MTS/M2TS and 3G2 always go straight to Download. Thumbnails depend on
  the same codecs, so an undecodable video shows a video icon (its duration is
  still recorded when readable).
- **iPhone picker conversions:** when you pick from the Photo Library, iOS
  may convert HEIC photos to JPEG and re-encode videos. To keep the exact
  originals, use *Choose File* and pick them from the Files app.
- **Uploads need the tab open.** Browsers pause or kill background tabs,
  especially on phones. Resumable uploads can be continued afterwards (see
  above), but nothing uploads while the app is closed.
- **Bulk download** builds the ZIP in browser memory and is capped at 1 GB per
  download.
- The **quota check** runs per insert, so a large parallel batch can overshoot by
  a few files. It counts metadata rows, so objects uploaded without a row (see
  orphans below) are not counted. Storage policies can't see the quota.
- If the browser closes after a file is uploaded but before its row is saved, an
  orphan object can remain. To find orphans:
  ```sql
  select o.name, o.created_at from storage.objects o
  where o.bucket_id = 'vault-files'
    and split_part(o.name, '/', 2) in ('images','screenshots','pdfs','documents','videos','other')
    and not exists (select 1 from public.files f where f.storage_path = o.name);
  ```
  Delete them from *Storage* in the dashboard, not with SQL.
- Trash is not emptied automatically. Use **Empty Trash**.
